Then go to your translations folder, if you do not have one please create one.
It should be listed under SCPSL_DATA

Then simply create a folder, or go to the folder you already made and call it whatever you want (if u already did skip this step)

Then download the latest version of the Modern English translations into your downloads.

Then open the file with winrar, or default windows extractor and you should see all the text documents.

Now do ctrl a on your keyboard (CMD+A if you are on mac) and copy these files or select them

Then put the two folders side by side together

Once you are done with that, open SCPSL and go to your settings and whatever you named the translations go to that foler and select the one (as i had mine as ModernEnglish2.0)

Then you are done with it and you can now play with the translations.
